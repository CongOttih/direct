			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp">What Is a Bond?</a><br>
			A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually includes the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.
			<br><br>
			Once again bonds are issued by governments and corporations when they want to raise money. By buying a bond, you're giving the issuer a loan, and they agree to pay you back the face value of the loan on a specific date, and to pay you periodic interest payments along the way, usually twice a year. There are two ways to make money by investing in bonds. The first is to hold those bonds until their maturity date and collect interest payments on them. Bond interest is usually paid twice a year. The second way to profit from bonds is to sell them at a price that's higher than what you pay initially.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp">What Are TIPS?</a><br>
			Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) is a Treasury bond that is indexed to an inflationary gauge to protect investors from the decline in the purchasing power of their money. The principal value of TIPS rises as inflation rises. Inflation is the pace at which prices increase throughout the U.S. economy as measured by the Consumer Price Index or CPI. Inflation becomes an issue when when there isn't a commensurate rise in real wage growth to offset the negative effects of rising prices. TIPS are issued with maturities of five, 10, and 30 years and are considered a low-risk investment because the U.S. government backs them. The principal amount is protected since investors will never receive less than the originally invested principal. You can buy Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) directly from the U.S. Treasury or through a bank, broker, or dealer.

			Stock market futures, also called market futures or equity index futures, are futures contracts that track a specific benchmark index like the S&P 500. While commodity futures require delivery of the underlying goods (IE: corn, sugar, crude oil), market futures contracts get settled with cash or get rolled over. Market futures allow traders to trade the direction of the underlying equity index, hedge equity positions and be used as a lead indicator for the markets and stocks. Unlike options that can expire worthless when out of the money, expiring market futures are rolled over into the next expiration month contract. Market futures contracts expire on the third Friday of each quarterly month, starting from March. Expiring contracts are rolled over to the next expiration month on the second Thursday of the week.

			Refers to the investor who owns an options contract. A call holder pays for the option to buy the stock based on the parameters of the contract. A put holder has the right to sell the stock.<br>
			<br>
			Holders are purchasing the right to buy or sell shares, but they aren’t obligated to do anything. Their contract grants them the freedom to decide when — or if — to exercise the option, or to sell the contract before it expires. If they end up with an out-of-the-money option, they can walk away and let the contract expire. They lose only the amount they paid for the option (the premium) plus the cost of trade commissions.

			Writers don’t have much flexibility compared to Holders. For example, when a call holder decides to exercise an option, the writer is obligated to fulfill the order and sell the stock at the strike price. If the writer doesn’t already own enough shares of the stock, he’ll have to buy shares at the going market price — even if it’s higher than the strike price — and sell them at a loss to the call holder.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp">What Is Out-The-Money?</a><br>
			Out of the money (OTM) is a term used to describe an option contract that only contains intrinsic value. These options will have a delta less than 50.0. An OTM call option will have a strike price that is higher than the market price of the underlying asset. Alternatively, an OTM put option has a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset. OTM options may be contrasted with in the money (ITM) options. Being out of the money doesn't mean a trader can't make a profit on that option. A trader could have bought a far out of the money option, but now that option is moving closer to being in the money (ITM). That option could end up being worth more than the trader paid for the option, even though it is currently out of the money. At expiry, though, an option is worthless if it is OTM.

For example, if SPX stock is trading at $75, then the SPX $75 call option is at the money and so is the SPX $75 put option.

			An in the money call option means the option holder has the opportunity to buy the security below its current market price. Alternatively, an in the money put option means the option holder can sell the security above its current market price. In the money options contracts have higher premiums. An option that is ITM does not necessarily mean the trader is making a profit on the trade. The expense of buying the option and any commission fees must also be considered. In the money options may be contrasted with out of the money (OTM) options.

			In a nutshell, your net worth is really everything you own of significance (your assets) minus what you owe in debts (your liabilities). Assets include cash and investments, your home and other real estate, cars or anything else of value you own. Liabilities are what you owe on those assets — including car loans, your mortgage, and student loan debt.<br>
			<br>
			Net worth is a measure of your financial health because it basically says what you would have left over if you sold all of your assets to pay all of your debts. Every financial move you make should be aimed at increasing your net worth. This means either increasing assets, or decreasing liabilities.

			The intrinsic value of an option represents the current value of the option, or in other words how much in the money it is. So the intrinsic value represents what the buyer would receive if he decided to exercise the option right now. For in the money options, intrinsic value is calculated as the difference of the current price of the underlying asset and the strike price of the option. For options that are out of the money or at the money, the intrinsic value is always zero. This is because a buyer would never exercise an option that would result in a loss. Instead, he would let the option expire and get no payoff. Since he receives no payoff, the intrinsic value of the option is nothing to him.

			Extrinsic value measures the difference between the market price of an option, called the premium, and its intrinsic value. Extrinsic value is also the portion of the worth that has been assigned to an option by factors other than the underlying asset's price. Extrinsic value is also known as "time value" because the time left until the option contract expires is one of the primary factors affecting the option premium. For example, an option with one month to expiration that is out of the money will have more extrinsic value than that of an out of the money option with one week to expiration. Extrinsic value rises with increase in volatility in the market.

If you don't sell your options before expiration, there will be an automatic exercise if the option is IN THE MONEY.

			A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the liquidity of the shares. The primary motive is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though the underlying value of the company has not changed. The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier. A stock split is usually done by companies that have seen their share price increase to levels that are either too high or are beyond the price levels of similar companies in their sector. The primary motive is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though the underlying value of the company has not changed. This has the practical effect of increasing liquidity in the stock. Stock splits do not affect short sellers in a material way.

			Another version of a stock split is the reverse split. This procedure is typically used by companies with low share prices that would like to increase these prices to either gain more respectability in the market or to prevent the company from being delisted (many stock exchanges will delist stocks if they fall below a certain price per share). Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, where a company divides, instead of multiplies, the number of shares that stockholders own, raising the market price accordingly. For example, in a reverse 1-for-5 split, 10 million outstanding shares at 50 cents each would now become 2 million shares outstanding at $2.50 per share.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thebalance.com/heikin-ashi-chart-basics-1031191">What Is Heikin Ashi?</a><br>
			Heikin Ashi is a type of trading chart that originated in Japan, and it's similar to candlestick charts in that the color of the candlestick denotes the direction the price is moving. The main difference between traditional candlestick charts and Heikin Ashi (HA) charts is that in HA charts the average price moves, creating a smoother appearance. Because the HA price bars are averaged, they don't show the exact open and close prices for a particular time period. Some traders want additional confirmation of trend direction, and Heikin Ashi charts are often used as a technical indicator on a typical candlestick chart, to help highlight and clarify the current trend.Heikin Ashi charts are sometimes used on their own, especially by swing traders or investors. Day traders tend to use Heikin Ashi charts more as an indicator, as HA charts have certain other benefits.

			A defined-contribution (DC) plan is a retirement plan that's typically tax-deferred, like a 401k or a 403b, in which the employer, employee or both make contributions on a regular basis. Individual accounts are set up for participants and benefits are based on the amounts credited to these accounts plus any investment earnings on the money in the account.

			Accounts receivable are legally enforceable claims for payment held by a business for goods supplied and/or services rendered that customers/clients have ordered but not paid for. These are generally in the form of invoices raised by a business and delivered to the customer for payment within an agreed time frame. AR is any amount of money owed by customers for purchases made on credit.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-a-drip/">What Is a DRIP?</a><br>
			A DRIP is a dividend reinvestment plan whereby cash dividends are reinvested to purchase more stock in the company. DRIPs use a technique called dollar-cost averaging intended to average out the price at which you buy stock as it moves up or down.<br>
			<br>
			To start a DRIP account, consumers can directly contact investor relations at the desired company. If the company, like Apple, doesn’t directly offer a DRIP program, but pays dividends, investors can work with a broker to set one up, though it would lack some features of a company-sponsored plan.

			The record date is the date that the company reviews its records to see which shareholders qualified for the next dividend payment. However, investors who buy shares on the record date will be too late to be eligible for the next dividend. The record date is merely a date for the companies that pay dividends to get their records in order.

			The payable date refers to the date that any declared stock dividends are due to be paid out. Investors who purchased their stock before the ex-dividend date are eligible to receive dividends on the payable date. It's important to note that if the stock is sold on or after the ex-dividend date, the investor will still get paid the next scheduled dividend.
