			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp">What Is a Stock?</a><br>
			A stock is a form of security that indicates the holder has proportionate ownership in the issuing corporation. Corporations issue (sell) stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. There are two main types of stock: <b>common</b> and <b>preferred</b>. Common stock usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders' meetings and to receive any dividends paid out by the corporation. Preferred stockholders generally do not have voting rights, though they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than the common stockholders. For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before common shareholders and have priority in the event that a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated. Stock holders do not own corporations; they own shares issued by corporations.

			A share refers to the stock certificate of a particular company. A single share of the stock represents fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. Holding a particular company's share makes you a shareholder.<br>
			<br>
			So if someone says she "owns shares," some people's inclination would be to respond, "shares in what company?". Similarly, an investor might tell his broker to buy him 100 shares of Google. If he said "buy 100 stocks," he'd be referring to a whole collection of companies ‚Äî 100 different ones, in fact.

The double-entry has two equal and corresponding sides known as debit and credit. The left-hand side is debit and right-hand side is credit.

			In accounting, an account is a record in the general ledger that is used to sort and store transactions. For example, companies will have a Cash account in which to record every transaction that increases or decreases the company's cash. Another account, Sales, will collect all of the amounts from the sale of merchandise. Most accounting systems require that every transaction will affect two or more accounts. For example, a cash sale will increase the Cash account and will increase the Sales account.

			<br>
			All accounts within the organization can be split into three types. An account can be of one and only one of the following type and not more. Here are the various types of accounts.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Personal:</b> Personal accounts make most intuitive sense. We keep a track of all the transactions that we have undertaken with a particular person in them. We all maintain personal accounts like the money we owe our friends, the grocer and so on.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Real:</b> Real accounts are accounts which have been created to account for tangible things. Accounts such as land and building, machinery a/c etc are called real accounts. Although they are not living beings, we still transact with such entities. Records of such transactions are kept in real accounts.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Nominal:</b> Nominal accounts are a special category of accounts. While the other accounts can hold balance and carry it forward, nominal account are automatically reset to zero as soon as the time period is over. Their balance is carried forward to other accounts and the books for that period are closed. Examples of such accounts are Profit a/c, depreciation a/c etc.<br>

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/three-golden-rules-accounting/">What Are Three Golden Rules Of Accounting?</a><br>
			<br>
			<b>1. Debit The Receiver, Credit The Giver</b><br>
			This principle is used in the case of personal accounts. When a person gives something to the organization, it becomes an inflow and therefore the person must be credit in the books of accounts. The converse of this is also true, which is why the receiver needs to be debited.<br>
			<br>
			<b>2. Debit What Comes In, Credit What Goes Out</b><br>
			This principle is applied in case of real accounts. Real accounts involve machinery, land and building etc. They have a debit balance by default. Thus when you debit what comes in, you are adding to the existing account balance. This is exactly what needs to be done. Similarly when you credit what goes out, you are reducing the account balance when a tangible asset goes out of the organization.<br>
			<br>
			<b>3. Debit All Expenses And Losses, Credit All Incomes And Gains</b><br>
			This rule is applied when the account in question is a nominal account. The capital of the company is a liability. Therefore it has a default credit balance. When you credit all incomes and gains, you increase the capital and by debiting expenses and losses, you decrease the capital. This is exactly what needs to be done for the system to stay in balance.<br>
			<br>
			The golden rules of accounting allow anyone to be a bookkeeper. They only need to understand the types of accounts and then diligently apply the rules.

			The Wall Street 30, also known as US30, Dow Jones 30, DJ30, or simply the Dow, is one of the most widely recognized stock market indices in the world. Historically, the index was created to track the movements of the largest industrial companies in America, however today it is comprised of thirty companies from all different sectors.<br> 
			<br>
			The index often faces criticism because it is a price-weighted average, which means a higher priced stock will have a greater influence over the index than those with a lower price and thus does not take into account percentage change. Additionally, many feel its inclusion of merely 30 stocks is not an accurate representation of the overall U.S. market performance. That being said, the companies it is comprised of are some of the largest household names not only in the United States, but also the world, such as Intel, Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs. This index is mainly traded through the foreign exchange market.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ArUtqy-hUxw">What Is a Lot?</a><br>
			Forex is commonly traded in specific amounts called lots, or basically the number of currency units you will buy or sell. The standard size for a lot is 100,000 units of currency, and now, there are also mini, micro, and nano lot sizes that are 10,000, 1,000, and 100 units. Again, a standard lot represents 100,000 units of any currency, whereas a mini-lot represents 10,000, and a micro-lot represents 1,000 units of any currency. A one-pip movement for a standard lot corresponds with a $10 change. For example, if you buy $100,000 against the Japanese yen at a rate of ¬•110.00 and the exchange rate moves to ¬•110.50, which is a 50 pip movement, you have made $500. Conversely, if the exchange rate falls 50 pips to ¬•109.50 your net profit and loss is minus $500.<br>

			A pip, short for point in percentage, represents a tiny measure of the change in a currency pair in the forex market. Pips are the most basic unit of measure in forex trading. It can be measured in terms of the quote or in terms of the underlying currency. A pip is a standardized unit and is the smallest amount by which a currency quote can change. It is usually $0.0001 for U.S.-dollar related currency pairs, which is more commonly referred to as 1/100th of 1%, or one basis point. In practical terms, a pip is one-hundredth of one percent, or the fourth decimal place (0.0001). Most currency pairs are quoted to the fourth (sometimes fifth) decimal place. A pip represents the fourth number. Even though a pip is a very small unit of measurement, forex traders are usually heavily leveraged and even a one pip difference can equate to significant profit or loss.<br>

The first listed currency of a currency pair is called the base currency, and the second currency is called the quote currency. The EUR/USD currency pair is considered the most liquid currency pair in the world. The USD/JPY is the second most popular currency pair in the world.<br>

			Account currency is simply the currency the brokerage account is recorded in. For example, as a forex trader, my account cash value is in USD. Typically, you open an account, deposit money denominated in your home country currency, and then buy and sell currency pairs. All your profits and losses will be converted into that particular currency.

			In the world of foreign exchange (forex) trading, an expert advisor (EA) is a piece of software that tells you when to make trades or even automatically initiates and executes trades according to preprogrammed instructions. Expert advisors are most often deployed on the MetaTrader 4 or 5 forex trading platforms. You can use an existing EA or create your own based on the trading parameters you like. These EAs are written in a programming language called MetaQuotes Language (MQL). Both MetaTrader and MQL were developed by MetaQuotes Software Corp.

			Fractional pips, known as "pipettes", exist to allow for tighter spreads. A fractional pip is equivalent to 1/10 of a pip, making it possible to view the EUR/USD currency pair with pipettes to five decimal places, while currency pairs with the yen as the quote currency to three decimal places.<br>

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thebalance.com/calculating-pip-value-in-forex-pairs-1031022">What Is Pip Value?</a><br>
			In foreign exchange (forex) trading, pip value can be a confusing topic. A pip is a unit of measurement for currency movement and is the fourth decimal place in most currency pairs. For example, if the EUR/USD moves from 1.1015 to 1.1016, that's a one pip movement. Most brokers provide fractional pip pricing, so you'll also see a fifth decimal place such as in 1.10165, where the 5 is equal to five-tenths of a pip, or five pipettes. How much of a profit or loss a pip of movement produces depends on both the currency pair you are trading and the currency you funded your trading account with. Pip value matters because it affects risk. If you don't know what the pip value is, you can't precisely calculate the ideal position size for a trade and you may end up risking too much or too little on a trade.<br>
			<br>
			The most heavily traded currency pairs in the world involve the U.S. dollar (USD). When USD is listed second in a pair, pip values are fixed and don't change if you have an account funded with U.S. dollars. The fixed pip amounts are: USD$10 for a standard lot, which is 100,000 units of currency. USD$1 for a mini lot, which is 10,000 units of currency. USD$0.10 for a micro lot, which is 1,000 units of currency. These pip values apply to any pair where the USD is listed second, such as the euro/U.S. dollar (EUR/USD), British pound/U.S. dollar (GBP/USD), Australian dollar/U.S. dollar (AUD/USD), and New Zealand dollar/ U.S. dollar (NZD/USD).<br>

			Yes! Forex options trade over-the-counter (OTC), and traders can choose prices and expiration dates which suit their hedging or profit strategy needs. Unlike futures, where the trader must fulfill the terms of the contract, options traders do not have that obligation at expiration. These options vary widely from one product to another depending on which entity is offering the option. Because of the risk of loss when writing options, most retail forex brokers do not allow traders to sell options contracts without high levels of capital for protection. Forex options come in two varieties, so-called vanilla options and SPOT options. SPOT options are binary in nature and pay out (or not) depending on the final condition of the option.

			Single payment options trading (SPOT) is a type of option product that not only lets investors request that certain conditions be met in order to receive desired payouts, but also gives investors the opportunity to govern the size of payouts they wish to receive if said conditions are met. The broker providing SPOT products will determine the likelihood that the conditions will be met and charge commissions accordingly. This type of arrangement is often referred to as a "binary option" because only the following two types of payouts are possible for the investor: The conditions set out by both parties come to fruition, and the investor collects the agreed-upon payout amount. Or, the event does not occur as planned, and the investor loses the full premium paid to the broker. SPOT is most commonly found in Forex markets.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp">What Is a Bond?</a><br>
			A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually includes the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.
			<br><br>
			Once again bonds are issued by governments and corporations when they want to raise money. By buying a bond, you're giving the issuer a loan, and they agree to pay you back the face value of the loan on a specific date, and to pay you periodic interest payments along the way, usually twice a year. There are two ways to make money by investing in bonds. The first is to hold those bonds until their maturity date and collect interest payments on them. Bond interest is usually paid twice a year. The second way to profit from bonds is to sell them at a price that's higher than what you pay initially.<br>

			Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) is a Treasury bond that is indexed to an inflationary gauge to protect investors from the decline in the purchasing power of their money. The principal value of TIPS rises as inflation rises. Inflation is the pace at which prices increase throughout the U.S. economy as measured by the Consumer Price Index or CPI. Inflation becomes an issue when when there isn't a commensurate rise in real wage growth to offset the negative effects of rising prices. TIPS are issued with maturities of five, 10, and 30 years and are considered a low-risk investment because the U.S. government backs them. The principal amount is protected since investors will never receive less than the originally invested principal. You can buy Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) directly from the U.S. Treasury or through a bank, broker, or dealer.

			Technically, bills, notes, and bonds are all bonds. They are all backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. They are all issued electronically (you don‚Äôt get a fancy piece of paper as you do with savings bonds). They can all be purchased either directly from the Treasury or through a broker.<br>
			<br>
			The major difference among them is the time you need to wait to collect your principal:<br>
			<br>
			Treasury bills have maturities of a year or less.<br>
			<br>
			Treasury notes are issued with maturities from two to ten years.<br>
			<br>
			Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their issue date.<br>
			<br>
			The bills, like savings bonds, are sold at a discount from their face value. You get the full amount when the bill matures. The notes and bonds, on the other hand, are sold at their face value, have a fixed interest rate, and kick off interest payments once every six months. The minimum denomination for all three is $1,000, and you can buy them all in any increment of $1,000.

			A fork in a blockchain can occur in any crypto-technology platform. You may think of the blocks in blockchains as cryptographic keys that move memory. Because the miners in a blockchain set the rules that move the memory in the network, these miners understand the new rules. However, all of the miners need to agree about the new rules and about what comprises a valid block in the chain. So when you want to change those rules you need to "fork it"‚Äîlike a fork in a road‚Äîto indicate that there's been a change in or a diversion to the protocol. The developers can then update all of the software to reflect the new rules.<br>
			<br>
			It is through this forking process that various digital currencies with names similar to bitcoin have come to be: bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and others. For the casual cryptocurrency investor, it can be difficult to tell the difference between these cryptocurrencies and to map the various forks onto a timeline.

			Trading involves more frequent transactions, such as the buying and selling of stocks, commodities, currency pairs, or other instruments. While investors may be content with annual returns of 10% to 15%, traders might seek a 10% return each month. Trading involves short-term strategies to maximize returns daily, monthly, or quarterly. The goal is to generate returns that outperform buy-and-hold investing. Long term investors are more likely to ride out short-term losses, while traders will attempt to make transactions that can help them profit quickly from fluctuating markets.

			Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate the parties to transact an asset at a predetermined future date and price. Here, the buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date. Underlying assets include physical commodities or other financial instruments. Futures contracts detail the quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. Futures can be used for hedging or trade speculation.<br>

			Stock market futures, also called market futures or equity index futures, are futures contracts that track a specific benchmark index like the S&P 500. While commodity futures require delivery of the underlying goods (IE: corn, sugar, crude oil), market futures contracts get settled with cash or get rolled over. Market futures allow traders to trade the direction of the underlying equity index, hedge equity positions and be used as a lead indicator for the markets and stocks. Unlike options that can expire worthless when out of the money, expiring market futures are rolled over into the next expiration month contract. Market futures contracts expire on the third Friday of each quarterly month, starting from March. Expiring contracts are rolled over to the next expiration month on the second Thursday of the week.

			A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type. It is a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. Investors and traders can buy and sell commodities directly in the spot (cash) market or via derivatives such as futures and options. Owning commodities in a broader portfolio is encouraged as a diversifier and a hedge against inflation.<br>

			A delivery date is the final date by which the underlying commodity for a futures or forward contract must be delivered for the terms of the contract to be fulfilled. Most futures contracts are used as a hedge to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in a commodity and are closed out with an offsetting position (selling to offset a long position and buying to offset a short position) before the actual delivery date.

			Unlike standard futures contracts, a forward contract can be customized to a commodity, amount and delivery date. Commodities traded can be grains, precious metals, natural gas, oil, or even poultry. A forward contract settlement can occur on a cash or delivery basis. Forward contracts do not trade on a centralized exchange and are therefore regarded as over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. While their OTC nature makes it easier to customize terms, the lack of a centralized clearinghouse also gives rise to a higher degree of default risk. As a result, forward contracts are not as easily available to the retail investor as futures contracts.

			Backwardation is when the current price of an underlying asset is higher than prices trading in the futures market. Backwardation can occur as a result of a higher demand for an asset currently than the contracts maturing in the coming months through the futures market. Traders use backwardation to make a profit by selling short at the current price and buy at the lower futures price. Backwardation is sometimes confused with an inverted futures curve. In essence, a futures market expects higher prices at longer maturities and lower prices as you move closer to the present day when you converge at the present spot price.<br>

			Clearing houses provide clearing and settlement services for futures traded at an exchange. They act as the neutral counterparty between every buyer and seller, ensuring the soundness and integrity of every trade. Clearing is a fundamental benefit in the futures markets. Long before a trade is cleared through a clearing house, clearing firms check the financial strength of both parties to the trade, whether they‚Äôre a big institution or an individual trader.<br>
			<br>
			They also provide access to trading platforms, where the buyer and seller agree on the price, quantity and maturity of the contract. Then, when the contract is cleared by matching these offsetting (one buy, one sell) positions together, the clearing house guarantees that both buyer and seller get paid. This offsetting or ‚Äúnetting‚Äù process takes risk out of the financial system as a whole.<br>

			The opposite of backwardation is contango, where the futures contract price is higher than the expected price at some future expiration. Again, contango is a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price. It usually occurs when an asset price is expected to rise over time. In all futures market scenarios, the futures prices will usually converge toward the spot prices as the contracts approach expiration. Contango tends to cause losses for investors in commodity ETFs that use futures contracts, but these losses can be avoided by buying ETFs that hold actual commodities.

			The term delivery month refers to a key characteristic of a futures contract that designates when the contract expires, and when the underlying asset must be delivered or settled. Delivery dates are displayed by exchanges. The exchange on which the futures contract is traded establishes a delivery location and the date within the delivery month when the delivery can take place. Not all futures contracts require physical delivery of a commodity, and many are settled in cash. The delivery month is also called the contract month.Traders must exit their position as close to the delivery month as possible otherwise they must take delivery of the commodity.<br>

In practice, most derivatives traders close out or roll over their expiring positions to avoid the prospect of physical delivery.<br>
			<br>
			If the first business day of the delivery month was Monday, Oct. 1, first notice day would typically fall one to three business days prior, so it could be Wednesday, Sept. 26, Thursday, Sept.27, or Friday, Sept. 28. Most investors close out their positions before first notice day because they don't want to own physical commodities. According to Futures Magazine, less than 1% of futures contracts actually go to physical delivery.

It simply means that, on the last day that a futures contract can be delivered to fulfill the terms of the contract, the price of the futures and the price of the underlying commodity will be nearly equal. The two prices must converge. If not, an arbitrage opportunity exists and the possibility for a risk-free profit.

			Out of the money (OTM) is a term used to describe an option contract that only contains intrinsic value. These options will have a delta less than 50.0. An OTM call option will have a strike price that is higher than the market price of the underlying asset. Alternatively, an OTM put option has a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset. OTM options may be contrasted with in the money (ITM) options. Being out of the money doesn't mean a trader can't make a profit on that option. A trader could have bought a far out of the money option, but now that option is moving closer to being in the money (ITM). That option could end up being worth more than the trader paid for the option, even though it is currently out of the money. At expiry, though, an option is worthless if it is OTM.

Liabilities are what you owe on those assets ‚Äî including car loans, your mortgage, and student loan debt.<br>
			<br>
			Net worth is a measure of your financial health because it basically says what you would have left over if you sold all of your assets to pay all of your debts. Every financial move you make should be aimed at increasing your net worth. This means either increasing assets, or decreasing liabilities.<br>

			"Exercising the option" means the buyer is opting to take advantage of the right to buy or sell the shares at the strike price prior to an option contract's expiration. The difference between sell to close and exercise is that with a sell to close you transfer the right to exercise to a new party. With exercise you get to buy/sell the stocks at the agreed price.

If everything is held constant, the option loses value as time moves closer to the maturity of the option. In other words, the theta will decrease even more as you get closer to expiration. Again, theta is a measurement of time decay. It shows you how much the option is likely to decrease in value every day, all other things being equal. A theta of -0.2836 means that the option will decrease about 28 cents in value every day.

So the intrinsic value represents what the buyer would receive if he decided to exercise the option right now. For in the money options, intrinsic value is calculated as the difference of the current price of the underlying asset and the strike price of the option. For options that are out of the money or at the money, the intrinsic value is always zero. This is because a buyer would never exercise an option that would result in a loss. Instead, he would let the option expire and get no payoff. Since he receives no payoff, the intrinsic value of the option is nothing to him.

			Extrinsic value measures the difference between the market price of an option, called the premium, and its intrinsic value. Extrinsic value is also the portion of the worth that has been assigned to an option by factors other than the underlying asset's price. Extrinsic value is also known as "time value" because the time left until the option contract expires is one of the primary factors affecting the option premium. For example, an option with one month to expiration that is out of the money will have more extrinsic value than that of an out of the money option with one week to expiration. Extrinsic value rises with increase in volatility in the market.

			Interest rates are the price you pay to borrow money (or on the flip side, the payment you receive when you lend money). They‚Äôre generally framed as percentages. Each year you either pay (if you‚Äôre borrowing) or receive (if you‚Äôre lending) this percentage of the total amount of the loan. Interest rates are one of the most important numbers in the economy because they influence how likely people are to borrow money.<br>
			<br>
			When central banks like the Fed change interest rates, it has a ripple effect throughout the broader economy. Lowering rates makes borrowing money cheaper. This encourages consumer and business spending and investment and can boost asset prices. However, it can also lead to problems such as inflation and liquidity traps, which undermines the effectiveness of low rates. This is why economists are so obsessed with interest rates. This one number can be thought of as a massive lever that can either spur loads of investments (with low rates), or slow things down when everyone‚Äôs getting a bit too excited (with high rates).

			Negative interest rates are an unconventional, and seemingly counterintuitive, monetary policy tool. Central banks impose the drastic measure of negative interest rates when they fear their national economies are slipping into a deflationary spiral, in which there is no spending‚Äîand hence, dropping prices, no profits, and no growth.<br>
			<br>
			In theory, negative interest rates should help to stimulate economic activity and stave off inflation, but policymakers remain cautious because there are several ways such a policy could backfire. Because banks have certain assets such as mortgages that are contractually tied to the prevailing interest rate, such negative rates could squeeze profit margins to the point where banks are actually willing to lend less. With negative interest rates, cash deposited at a bank yields a storage charge, rather than the opportunity to earn interest income.

			A bank run occurs when a large number of customers of a bank or other financial institution withdraw their deposits simultaneously over concerns of the bank's solvency. As more people withdraw their funds, the probability of default increases, prompting more people to withdraw their deposits. In extreme cases, the bank's reserves may not be sufficient to cover the withdrawals.<br>

			The Great Recession is a term that represents the sharp decline in economic activity during the late 2000s. This period is considered the most significant downturn since the Great Depression. The term Great Recession applies to both the U.S. recession, officially lasting from December 2007 to June 2009, and the ensuing global recession in 2009. The economic slump began when the U.S. housing market went from boom to bust, and large amounts of mortgage-backed securities (MBS's) and derivatives lost significant value.<br>

			The Great Depression was the greatest and longest economic recession in modern world history. It began with the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and did not end until 1946 after World War II. Economists and historians often cite the Great Depression as the most catastrophic economic event of the 20th century. During the short depression that lasted from 1920 to 1921, known as the Forgotten Depression, the U.S. stock market fell by nearly 50%, and corporate profits declined over 90%. However, the U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth during the rest of the decade. The Roaring Twenties, as the era came to be known, was a period when the American public discovered the stock market and dove in head first.<br>
			<br>
			The lead-up to October 1929 saw equity prices rise to all-time high multiples of more than 30-times earnings, and the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 500% in just five years. The NYSE bubble burst violently Oct. 24, 1929, a day that came to be known as Black Thursday. A brief rally occurred Friday the 25th and during a half-day session Saturday the 26th. However, the following week brought Black Monday, Oct. 28, and Black Tuesday, Oct. 29. The Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA) fell more than 20% over those two days. The stock market would eventually fall almost 90% from its 1929 peak. Ripples from the crash spread across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe triggering other financial crises such as the collapse of the Boden-Kredit Anstalt, Austria‚Äôs most important bank. In 1931, the economic calamity hit both continents in full force.<br>

			Credit is the most important part of the economy. It is a transaction between a lender and a borrower, in which the borrower promises to pay back the money in the future along with interest. Credit leads to an increase in spending, thus increasing income levels in the economy. This, in turn, leads to higher GDP (gross domestic product) and thereby faster productivity growth. If credit is used to purchase productive resources, it helps in economic growth and adds to income. Credit further leads to the creation of debt cycles.

			Debt is an obligation that requires one party, the debtor, to pay money or other agreed-upon value to another party, the creditor. Debt is a deferred payment, or series of payments, which differentiates it from an immediate purchase. A debt arrangement gives the borrowing party permission to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest. The most common forms of debt are loans, including mortgages and auto loans, personal loans, and credit card debt.

			To summarize, a bank works by paying people small amounts to lend them money, then lending that money onto others for larger amounts. They manage that whole process, and then keep the difference between the large amount (interest on loans) and small amount (interest from a savings account). A bank is a business like any other business: it strives to make as much money as possible. They make money by simply moving money around.

			An economic bubble or asset bubble is a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. It could also be described as trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. It is created by a surge in asset prices unwarranted by the fundamentals of the asset and driven by exuberant market behavior. When no more investors are willing to buy at the elevated price, a massive sell-off occurs, causing the bubble to deflate.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtdeflation.asp">What Is Debt Deflation?</a><br>
			Debt deflation, which often occurs after a debt bubble has burst, happens when too much debt depresses the value of properties, goods, or services. Borrowers will typically experience decreasing property values from debt deflation, which can lead to an array of other negative repercussions. In the broad market, debt deflation generally refers to a theory that identifies total outstanding debts as a catalyst for price decreases across a country‚Äôs economy. When debt issuance reaches new peaks, it can deflate the value of real currency. As debt issuance increases, the risk for default rates are also higher.<br>
			<br>
			The mortgage market is one area highly prone to debt deflation since it encompasses a large portion of the total debt outstanding overall. In a debt-deflation cycle borrowers can struggle with paying their mortgage debt and decreasing property value of the collateral used to secure their debt in a mortgage loan. It can lead to higher rates of foreclosure. Declining property values can lead to underwater mortgages, even foreclosures, when debt deflation strikes the mortgage industry.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquiditytrap.asp">What Is a Liquidity Trap?</a><br>
			A liquidity trap is a contradictory economic situation in which interest rates are very low and savings rates are high, rendering monetary policy ineffective. First described by economist John Maynard Keynes, during a liquidity trap, consumers choose to avoid bonds and keep their funds in cash savings because of the prevailing belief that interest rates could soon rise (which would push bond prices down). Because bonds have an inverse relationship to interest rates, many consumers do not want to hold an asset with a price that is expected to decline. At the same time, central bank efforts to spur economic activity are hampered as they are unable to lower interest rates further to incentivize investors and consumers. While a liquidity trap is a function of economic conditions, it is also psychological since consumers are making a choice to hoard cash instead of choosing higher-paying investments because of a negative economic view.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/islmmodel.asp">What Is The IS-LM Model?</a><br>
			The IS-LM model, which stands for "investment-savings" (IS) and "liquidity preference-money supply" (LM) is a Keynesian macroeconomic model that shows how the market for economic goods (IS) interacts with the loanable funds market (LM) or money market. It is represented as a graph in which the IS and LM curves intersect to show the short-run equilibrium between interest rates and output. The IS-LM model describes how aggregate markets for real goods and financial markets interact to balance the rate of interest and total output in the macroeconomy. IS-LM can be used to describe how changes in market preferences alter the equilibrium levels of GDP and market interest rates, but the model lacks the precision and realism to be a useful prescription tool for economic policy.<br>

			Regular trading hours for the U.S. stock market, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq), are 9:30 AM to 4 PM Eastern time on weekdays (except stock market holidays). And, 8:30 AM to 3 PM Central time. On early-closure days, typically right before or right after a market holiday, regular stock trading ends at 1 PM ET (12 PM CT).<br>
			<br>
			That said, trading can occur outside of normal stock market hours. For instance, on days with a regular session, there is "pre-market" trading; while hours vary, they can extend as early as 4 a.m. and go through the market open at 9:30 a.m. There are also "after-hours" sessions, which typically span from 4 to 8 p.m.

			Technical analysis (TA) is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity. Technical analysis tools are used to scrutinize the ways supply and demand for a security will affect changes in price, volume, and implied volatility. Technical analysis is often used to generate short-term trading signals from various charting tools, but can also help improve the evaluation of a security's strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its sectors. Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements.

			Fundamental analysis (FA) is a method of measuring a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management. The end goal is to arrive at a number that an investor can compare with a security's current price in order to see whether the security is undervalued or overvalued. Fundamental analysts search for stocks that are currently trading at prices that are higher or lower than their real value. It is a method of determining a stock's real or "fair market" value.<br>

			A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the liquidity of the shares. The primary motive is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though the underlying value of the company has not changed. The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier. A stock split is usually done by companies that have seen their share price increase to levels that are either too high or are beyond the price levels of similar companies in their sector. The primary motive is to make shares seem more affordable to small investors even though the underlying value of the company has not changed. This has the practical effect of increasing liquidity in the stock. Stock splits do not affect short sellers in a material way.<br>

			Another version of a stock split is the reverse split. This procedure is typically used by companies with low share prices that would like to increase these prices to either gain more respectability in the market or to prevent the company from being delisted (many stock exchanges will delist stocks if they fall below a certain price per share). Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, where a company divides, instead of multiplies, the number of shares that stockholders own, raising the market price accordingly. For example, in a reverse 1-for-5 split, 10 million outstanding shares at 50 cents each would now become 2 million shares outstanding at $2.50 per share. In both cases, the company is still worth $5 million.<br>

The main difference between traditional candlestick charts and Heikin Ashi (HA) charts is that in HA charts the average price moves, creating a smoother appearance. Because the HA price bars are averaged, they don't show the exact open and close prices for a particular time period. Some traders want additional confirmation of trend direction, and Heikin Ashi charts are often used as a technical indicator on a typical candlestick chart, to help highlight and clarify the current trend.Heikin Ashi charts are sometimes used on their own, especially by swing traders or investors. Day traders tend to use Heikin Ashi charts more as an indicator, as HA charts have certain other benefits.<br>

			Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security‚Äôs price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.<br>
			<br>
			The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell - or short - the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.<br>

			A descending triangle is a bearish chart pattern used in technical analysis that is created by drawing one trend line that connects a series of lower highs and a second horizontal trend line that connects a series of lows. Oftentimes, traders watch for a move below the lower support trend line because it suggests that the downward momentum is building and a breakdown is imminent. Once the breakdown occurs, traders enter into short positions and aggressively help push the price of the asset even lower.<br>

			The Falling Wedge is a bullish pattern that begins wide at the top and contracts as prices move lower. This price action forms a cone that slopes down as the reaction highs and reaction lows converge. In contrast to symmetrical triangles, which have no definitive slope and no bias, falling wedges definitely slope down and have a bullish bias. However, this bullish bias cannot be realized until a resistance breakout occurs. As a reversal pattern, the falling wedge slopes down and with the prevailing trend. Regardless of the type (reversal or continuation), falling wedges are regarded as bullish patterns.<br>

			While though this article will focus on the rising wedge as a reversal pattern, the pattern can also fit into the continuation category. As a continuation pattern, the rising wedge will still slope up, but the slope will be against the prevailing downtrend. As a reversal pattern, the rising wedge will slope up and with the prevailing trend. Regardless of the type (reversal or continuation), rising wedges are bearish.<br>

			A head and shoulders pattern is a chart formation that appears as a baseline with three peaks, the outside two are close in height and the middle is highest. In technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern describes a specific chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. The head and shoulders pattern is believed to be one of the most reliable trend reversal patterns. It is one of several top patterns that signal, with varying degrees of accuracy, that an upward trend is nearing its end.<br>

			An inverse head and shoulders, also called a "head and shoulders bottom", is similar to the standard head and shoulders pattern, but inverted: with the head and shoulders top used to predict reversals in downtrends. This pattern is identified when the price action of a security meets the following characteristics: the price falls to a trough and then rises; the price falls below the former trough and then rises again; finally, the price falls again but not as far as the second trough. Once the final trough is made, the price heads upward, toward the resistance found near the top of the previous troughs.<br>

			Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day. For instance, stock trading volume would refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close. Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders because it is used to measure the relative significance of a market move. The higher the volume during a price move, the more significant the move and the lower the volume during a price move, the less significant the move.<br>

			The term bid and ask (also known as bid and offer) refers to a two-way price quotation that indicates the best potential price at which a security can be sold and bought at a given point in time. The bid price represents the maximum price that a buyer is willing to pay for a share of stock or other security. The ask price represents the minimum price that a seller is willing to take for that same security. A trade or transaction occurs after the buyer and seller agree on a price for the security which is no higher than the bid and no lower than the ask. The difference between these two prices is known as the spread; the smaller the spread, the greater the liquidity of the given security.<br>

			Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often measured as either the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index.<br>
			<br>
			In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a "volatile" market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts.<br>

			An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA), which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period.<br>
			<br>Like all moving averages, this technical indicator is used to produce buy and sell signals based on crossovers and divergences from the historical average. Traders often use several different EMA lengths, such as 10-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.<br>

			A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a security when it reaches a certain price. Stop-loss orders are designed to limit an investor‚Äôs loss on a position in a security and are different from stop-limit orders. When a stock falls below the stop price the order becomes a market order and it executes at the next available price.<br> 
			<br>
			For example, a trader may buy a stock and places a stop-loss order 10% below the purchase price. Should the stock drop, the stop-loss order would be activated, and the stock would be sold as a market order. In many cases, stop-loss orders are used to prevent investor losses when the price of a security drops. Although most investors associate a stop-loss order with a long position, it can also protect a short position, in which case the security gets bought if it trades above a defined price.<br>

			In technical analysis of securities trading, the stochastic oscillator (Stochastics) is a momentum indicator that uses support and resistance levels. Dr. George Lane developed this indicator in the late 1950s. The term stochastic refers to the point of a current price in relation to its price range over a period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result.<br>

			It is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can be generated by looking for divergences and failure swings. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend.<br>

			The last price of a stock is just one price to consider when buying or selling shares. The last price is simply the most recent one. For example, if shares of Microsoft (MSFT) trade $50 per share, then $51, and then $50, and then $49. The last price is the most recent transaction, but it doesn't always accurately represent the price you would get if you were to buy or sell right now.

			Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. They are based on Fibonacci numbers. Each level is associated with a percentage. The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 50% is also used.<br>
			<br>
			The indicator is useful because it can be drawn between any two significant price points, such as a high and a low. The indicator will then create the levels between those two points.<br>
			<br>
			Suppose the price of a stock rises $10 and then drops $2.36. In that case, it has retraced 23.6%, which is a Fibonacci number. Fibonacci numbers are found throughout nature. Therefore, many traders believe that these numbers also have relevance in financial markets.<br>

			A DRIP is a dividend reinvestment plan whereby cash dividends are reinvested to purchase more stock in the company. DRIPs use a technique called dollar-cost averaging intended to average out the price at which you buy stock as it moves up or down.<br>
			<br>
			To start a DRIP account, consumers can directly contact investor relations at the desired company. If the company, like Apple, doesn‚Äôt directly offer a DRIP program, but pays dividends, investors can work with a broker to set one up, though it would lack some features of a company-sponsored plan.<br>

			The record date is the date that the company reviews its records to see which shareholders qualified for the next dividend payment. However, investors who buy shares on the record date will be too late to be eligible for the next dividend. The record date is merely a date for the companies that pay dividends to get their records in order.

			The payable date refers to the date that any declared stock dividends are due to be paid out. Investors who purchased their stock before the ex-dividend date are eligible to receive dividends on the payable date. It's important to note that if the stock is sold on or after the ex-dividend date, the investor will still get paid the next scheduled dividend.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/cF4DqOSm4PU">How Much Needs To Be In a Portfolio To Live Off Dividends?</a><br>
			One of the best reasons why stocks should be part of every investor's portfolio is, unlike the interest from bonds, stock dividends tend to grow over time. More importantly, that dividend growth has historically outpaced inflation. For those investors with a long timeline, this fact can be exploited in order to create a portfolio that can be used strictly for dividend-income living. The smart strategy lies within using those dividends to buy more shares of stock in a firm so that they will receive even more dividends and buy even more shares. By investing in quality dividend stocks with rising payouts, both young and old investors can benefit from the stocks' compounding, and historically inflation-beating, distribution growth. All it takes is a little planning and investors can live off their dividend payment streams.<br>
