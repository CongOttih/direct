			<br>
			Hugh's Trading Room Question:<br>
			I noticed that sometimes when I buy an option and the market goes against me but later comes back to the level I bought it at, the option is completely not the same in terms of price. Even if there's a good market move in my favor on the same day I bought it, it doesn't impact my option as much. Why is that?
			<span><br><br></span>
			Answer:<br>
			There are three things that come into action.</br>
			1. Theta</br>
			2. Volatility</br>
			3. Bid Ask Spread.
			<span><br><br><br></span>
			Hugh's Trading Room Question: <br>
			How much of my account should I risk per trade in terms of percentage?
			<span><br><br></span>
			Answer: <br>
			No more than 15%. As you become more experienced, the more that number can go up or down & be flexible. But when starting out, 15% is a good number.

			Hugh's Trading Room Question: <br> 
			What does it mean when the MACD lines crossover, and which time frame is it most important in?

			The bid–ask spread, is the difference between the prices quoted for an immediate sale and an immediate purchase for stocks, futures contracts, options, or currency pairs.

			A margin account is a brokerage account in which the broker lends the investor money to buy more securities than what they could otherwise buy with the balance in their account. Using margin to purchase securities is effectively like using the current cash or securities already in your account as collateral for a loan.

			<br>
			Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures that have not been settled for an asset. The total open interest does not count, and total every buy and sell contract. Instead, open interest provides a more accurate picture of the options trading activity, and whether money flows into the futures and options market are increasing or decreasing.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp">What Is a REIT?</a><br>
			A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company owning and typically operating real estate which generates income. Most REITs specialize in a specific real estate sector, focusing their time, energy, and funding on that particular segment of the entire real estate horizon.<br>
			<br>
			Properties included in a REIT portfolio may include apartment complexes, data centers, health care facilities, hotels, infrastructure—in the form of fiber cables, cell towers, and energy pipelines—office buildings, retail centers, self-storage, timberland, and warehouses. One benefit of REITs for everyday investors is that they provide the opportunity to own a portion of real estate which generates dividend-based income.
