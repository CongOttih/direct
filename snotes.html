			<br>
			Hugh's Trading Room Question:<br>
			I noticed that sometimes when I buy an option and the market goes against me but later comes back to the level I bought it at, the option is completely not the same in terms of price. Even if there's a good market move in my favor on the same day I bought it, it doesn't impact my option as much. Why is that?
			<span><br><br></span>
			Answer:<br>
			There are three things that come into action.</br>
			1. Theta</br>
			2. Volatility</br>
			3. Bid Ask Spread.
			<span><br><br><br></span>
			Hugh's Trading Room Question: <br>
			How much of my account should I risk per trade in terms of percentage?
			<span><br><br></span>
			Answer: <br>
			No more than 15%. As you become more experienced, the more that number can go up or down & be flexible. But when starting out, 15% is a good number.

			Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures that have not been settled for an asset.

			A portfolio investment is ownership of a stock, bond, or other financial asset with the expectation that it will earn a return or grow in value over time, or both. It entails passive or hands-off ownership of assets as opposed to direct investment, which would involve an active management role.	In fact, a portfolio investment can be any possession that is purchased for the purpose of generating a return in the short or long term.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/blog/what-does-your-net-worth-really-mean/">What Makes My Net Worth?</a><br>
			In a nutshell, your net worth is really everything you own of significance (your assets) minus what you owe in debts (your liabilities). Assets include cash and investments, your home and other real estate, cars or anything else of value you own. Liabilities are what you owe on those assets — including car loans, your mortgage, and student loan debt.<br>
			<br>
			Net worth is a measure of your financial health because it basically says what you would have left over if you sold all of your assets to pay all of your debts. Every financial move you make should be aimed at increasing your net worth. This means either increasing assets, or decreasing liabilities.

			Rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio of assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling assets in a portfolio to maintain an original or desired level of asset allocation or risk.<br>
			<br>
			For example, say an original target asset allocation was 50% stocks and 50% bonds. If the stocks performed well during the period, it could have increased the stock weighting of the portfolio to 70%. The investor may then decide to sell some stocks and buy bonds to get the portfolio back to the original target allocation of 50/50.

			The dividend growth rate is the average rate of growth a stock’s dividend has experienced for a specific period of time. Dividend growth is an immensely important statistic for investors to focus on. But often what’s more important than the current size of the dividend is the pace at which it has been growing (or shrinking). You see, growing dividends are a sign of a healthy stock, one that is committed to its shareholders, and may also be an indication of more dividend raises to come.

			A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company owning and typically operating real estate which generates income. Most REITs specialize in a specific real estate sector, focusing their time, energy, and funding on that particular segment of the entire real estate horizon.<br>
			<br>
			Properties included in a REIT portfolio may include apartment complexes, data centers, health care facilities, hotels, infrastructure—in the form of fiber cables, cell towers, and energy pipelines—office buildings, retail centers, self-storage, timberland, and warehouses. One benefit of REITs for everyday investors is that they provide the opportunity to own a portion of real estate which generates dividend-based income.

			The ex-dividend date, also known as the reinvestment date, is an investment term involving the timing of payment of dividends on stocks of corporations, income trusts, and other financial holdings, both publicly and privately held.<br>
			<br>
			When a company declares a dividend, it sets a record date when you must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is normally two business days before the record date. If you purchase a stock on or after its ex-dividend date, you will not receive the next dividend payment.
