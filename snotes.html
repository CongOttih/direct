			Question:<br>
			I noticed that sometimes when I buy an option and the market goes against me but later comes back to the level I bought it at, the option is completely not the same in terms of price. Even if there's a good market move in my favor on the same day I bought it, it doesn't impact my option as much. Why is that?

			Answer:<br>
			There are three things that come into action.</br>

			2. Volatility</br>

			<span><br><br></span>
			Answer: <br>
			No more than 15%. As you become more experienced, the more that number can go up or down & be flexible. But when starting out, 15% is a good number.

			Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest.

			Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures that have not been settled for an asset. The total open interest does not count, and total every buy and sell contract. Instead, open interest provides a more accurate picture of the options trading activity, and whether money flows into the futures and options market are increasing or decreasing.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp">What Is Included In Investment Portfolios?</a><br>
			A portfolio investment is ownership of a stock, bond, or other financial asset with the expectation that it will earn a return or grow in value over time, or both. It entails passive or hands-off ownership of assets as opposed to direct investment, which would involve an active management role.	In fact, a portfolio investment can be any possession that is purchased for the purpose of generating a return in the short or long term.

			<br>
			Holders are purchasing the right to buy or sell shares, but they aren’t obligated to do anything. Their contract grants them the freedom to decide when — or if — to exercise the option, or to sell the contract before it expires. If they end up with an out-of-the-money option, they can walk away and let the contract expire. They lose only the amount they paid for the option (the premium) plus the cost of trade commissions.

			Refers to the investor who is selling the options contract. The writer receives the premium from the holder in exchange for the promise to buy or sell the specified shares at the strike price, if the holder exercises the option.<br>
			<br>
			Writers don’t have much flexibility compared to Holders. For example, when a call holder decides to exercise an option, the writer is obligated to fulfill the order and sell the stock at the strike price. If the writer doesn’t already own enough shares of the stock, he’ll have to buy shares at the going market price — even if it’s higher than the strike price — and sell them at a loss to the call holder.

			<a target="_blank" href="">What Is Out-The-Money?</a><br>
			Out of the money (OTM) is a term used to describe an option contract that only contains intrinsic value. These options will have a delta less than 50.0. An OTM call option will have a strike price that is higher than the market price of the underlying asset. Alternatively, an OTM put option has a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset. OTM options may be contrasted with in the money (ITM) options. Being out of the money doesn't mean a trader can't make a profit on that option. A trader could have bought a far out of the money option, but now that option is moving closer to being in the money (ITM). That option could end up being worth more than the trader paid for the option, even though it is currently out of the money. At expiry, though, an option is worthless if it is OTM.

			At the money (ATM) is a situation where an option's strike price is identical to the price of the underlying security. Both call and put options can be simultaneously ATM. For example, if SPX stock is trading at $75, then the SPX $75 call option is at the money and so is the SPX $75 put option. Some traders would consider an option contract to be slightly OTM or ITM if the contract is one or two contracts away from being ATM.

			An in the money call option means the option holder has the opportunity to buy the security below its current market price. Alternatively, an in the money put option means the option holder can sell the security above its current market price. In the money options contracts have higher premiums. An option that is ITM does not necessarily mean the trader is making a profit on the trade. The expense of buying the option and any commission fees must also be considered. In the money options may be contrasted with out of the money (OTM) options.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/blog/what-does-your-net-worth-really-mean/">What Makes My Net Worth?</a><br>
			In a nutshell, your net worth is really everything you own of significance (your assets) minus what you owe in debts (your liabilities). Assets include cash and investments, your home and other real estate, cars or anything else of value you own. Liabilities are what you owe on those assets — including car loans, your mortgage, and student loan debt.<br>
			<br>
			Net worth is a measure of your financial health because it basically says what you would have left over if you sold all of your assets to pay all of your debts. Every financial move you make should be aimed at increasing your net worth. This means either increasing assets, or decreasing liabilities.

			"Exercising the option" means the buyer is opting to take advantage of the right to buy or sell the shares at the strike price prior to an option contract's expiration. The difference between sell to close and exercise is that with a sell to close you transfer the right to exercise to a new party. With exercise you get to buy/sell the stocks at the agreed price.

If the stocks performed well during the period, it could have increased the stock weighting of the portfolio to 70%.

			The dividend growth rate is the average rate of growth a stock’s dividend has experienced for a specific period of time. Dividend growth is an immensely important statistic for investors to focus on. But often what’s more important than the current size of the dividend is the pace at which it has been growing (or shrinking). You see, growing dividends are a sign of a healthy stock, one that is committed to its shareholders, and may also be an indication of more dividend raises to come.

			A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company owning and typically operating real estate which generates income. Most REITs specialize in a specific real estate sector, focusing their time, energy, and funding on that particular segment of the entire real estate horizon.<br>
			<br>
			Properties included in a REIT portfolio may include apartment complexes, data centers, health care facilities, hotels, infrastructure—in the form of fiber cables, cell towers, and energy pipelines—office buildings, retail centers, self-storage, timberland, and warehouses. One benefit of REITs for everyday investors is that they provide the opportunity to own a portion of real estate which generates dividend-based income.

			Bonds are issued by governments and corporations when they want to raise money. By buying a bond, you're giving the issuer a loan, and they agree to pay you back the face value of the loan on a specific date, and to pay you periodic interest payments along the way, usually twice a year.<br>
			<br>
			There are two ways to make money by investing in bonds. The first is to hold those bonds until their maturity date and collect interest payments on them. Bond interest is usually paid twice a year. The second way to profit from bonds is to sell them at a price that's higher than what you pay initially.

			A FICO score is a type of credit score created by the Fair Isaac Corporation. Lenders use borrowers' FICO scores along with other details on borrowers' credit reports to assess credit risk and determine whether to extend credit. FICO scores take into account various factors in five areas to determine creditworthiness: payment history, current level of indebtedness, types of credit used, length of credit history, and new credit accounts.

			The Dividend Advantage Rating System (DARS) is an exclusive and proprietary ratings model used by Dividend.com to assess the long-term sustainability, growth and safety of a stock’s underlying dividend. It works on a scale of (weak) 1-to-5 (strongest). Sophisticated algorithms filter 7,000 stocks and ETFs  through five key metrics including dividend relative strength, overall yield attractiveness, reliability, uptrend and earnings growth to generate the DARS score. The highest DARS rated stocks are updated daily under Best Dividend Stocks on Dividend.com

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp">What Is an Ex-Dividend Date?</a><br>
			The ex-dividend date, also known as the reinvestment date, is an investment term involving the timing of payment of dividends on stocks of corporations, income trusts, and other financial holdings, both publicly and privately held.<br>
			<br>
			When a company declares a dividend, it sets a record date when you must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is normally two business days before the record date. If you purchase a stock on or after its ex-dividend date, you will not receive the next dividend payment.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/3502816-understanding-difference-correction-and-start-of-recession">What Is The Difference Between a Correction & a Recession?</a><br>
			During a correction, prices fall significantly across a single asset, industry or an entire market. Corrections can be caused by any negative event that sparks selling. Anything from a new announcement from the Fed, poor jobs numbers or higher-than-expected inflation. By contrast, a bear market is a downturn that is longer and is caused by a recession - a real contraction in the economy. A recession occurs when an entire economy contracts for several months.

			<a target="_blank" href="">What Is a Defined-Contribution (DC) Plan?</a><br>
			A defined-contribution (DC) plan is a retirement plan that's typically tax-deferred, like a 401k or a 403b, in which the employer, employee or both make contributions on a regular basis. Individual accounts are set up for participants and benefits are based on the amounts credited to these accounts plus any investment earnings on the money in the account.

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-a-drip/">What Is a DRIP?</a><br>
			A DRIP is a dividend reinvestment plan whereby cash dividends are reinvested to purchase more stock in the company. DRIPs use a technique called dollar-cost averaging intended to average out the price at which you buy stock as it moves up or down.<br>
			<br>
			To start a DRIP account, consumers can directly contact investor relations at the desired company. If the company, like Apple, doesn’t directly offer a DRIP program, but pays dividends, investors can work with a broker to set one up, though it would lack some features of a company-sponsored plan.
