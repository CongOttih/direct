	Hugh's Trading Room Question: Hey good morning guys! I noticed that sometimes when I buy an option and the market goes against me but later comes back to the level I bought it at, the option is completely not the same in terms of price. Even if there's a good market move in my favor on the same day I bought it, it doesn't impact my option as much. Why is that?
	<br>
	Answer: There are three things that come into action; 1. Theta 2.Volatility & 3.Bid Ask Spread.
	<br>
	Hugh's Trading Room Question: How much of my account should I risk per trade in terms of percentage?
	<br>
	Answer: No more than 15%. As you become more experienced, the more that number can go up or down & be flexible. But when starting out, 15% is a good number.
