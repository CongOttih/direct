	Hugh's Trading Room Question:<br>
	I noticed that sometimes when I buy an option and the market goes against me but later comes back to the level I bought it at, the option is completely not the same in terms of price. Even if there's a good market move in my favor on the same day I bought it, it doesn't impact my option as much. Why is that?
	<span><br><br></span>
	Answer:<br>
	There are three things that come into action; 1. Theta 2.Volatility & 3.Bid Ask Spread.
	<span><br><br><br></span>
	Hugh's Trading Room Question: <br>
	How much of my account should I risk per trade in terms of percentage?
	<span><br><br></span>
	Answer: <br>
	No more than 15%. As you become more experienced, the more that number can go up or down & be flexible. But when starting out, 15% is a good number.
	<span><br><br><br></span>
	Hugh's Trading Room Question: <br> 
	What does it mean when the MACD lines crossover, and which time frame is it most important in?
