      <p class="text"><span class="sub-title">Q: What is this project about?</span><br>A: It is a website for calculating & tracking the total amount of protein you should take daily. Due to COVID19, a lack of resources, and the slowest internet connection possible, this project has been completed to the best of it's ability. If I had the proper resources, I would've also paid my nutritionist in Lubbock, Texas a proper visit. FOR A PROPER PRESENTATION, PLEASE VIEW THIS WEBSITE WITH YOUR WEBPAGE ZOOMED IN AT 50%. ENJOY. </p><br>
      
      <p class="text"><span class="sub-title">Q: How much protein can I have per meal?</span></br>A: The human body can only take 20-40 grams of protein in one meal or sitting.</p><br>
  
      <p class="text"><span class="sub-title">Q: How much protein can I have each day?</span></br>A: <em>For men</em>, it is recommended to take 0.8 gram of protein per pound of body weight to maintain mass. And, 1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight if you're trying to gain mass. <br><em>For women</em>, it is recommended to take 0.8 gram of protein per pound of body weight to maintain mass. And, 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight if you're trying to gain mass.</p>
 
      <p class="text"><span class="sub-title">Q: What if I want to gain mass, but I can't have that much protein in a day?</span><br>A: Then, consider the your calculated amount for maintaining mass rather than gaining mass. The (maintain - maximum gain) range gives you a better idea of the minimum and maximum amounts of protein you could take in order to see muscle growth. <br>For example, "(180g of protein - 270g of protein) is the <br> (minimum - maximum) range for my daily amount of protein."</p><br>
